# .github Repository for Wiley Organization

This repository serves as a centralized location for managing organization-wide GitHub configurations, templates, and workflows. It streamlines processes and enhances consistency across all repositories within the organization.

## Purpose

1. **Default Community Health Files**  
   Provides default versions of community health files such as:
   - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`

   These files are automatically applied to all repositories in the organization unless overridden by a repository-specific version.

2. **Organization-Level Workflows**  
   Contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows stored in `.github/workflows`. These workflows can be referenced in individual repositories to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

3. **Profile Customization**  
   The repository can include a `profile/README.md` file to customize the organization's GitHub profile page.

## Important Notes

- This repository does not contain any private, sensitive, or proprietary information.  
- All content is designed for public visibility and complies with GitHub's guidelines for `.github` repositories.
